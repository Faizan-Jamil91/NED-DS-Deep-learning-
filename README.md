Overview
This document provides an overview of the exploration of Gradient Descent algorithms and the step-by-step process of building a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model using Python and TensorFlow. It includes explanations of key concepts and code snippets for practical implementation.

Gradient Descent
Description
Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function of a model by adjusting the model parameters iteratively. It is essential for training machine learning models.

Types of Gradient Descent
Batch Gradient Descent

Uses the entire dataset to compute gradients and update parameters.
Pros: Stable and accurate gradient estimation.
Cons: Computationally expensive for large datasets.
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

Uses a single sample or a small batch to compute gradients and update parameters.
Pros: Faster and requires less memory; can escape local minima.
Cons: Noisy updates; slower convergence.
Mini-Batch Gradient Descent

Uses small random subsets of the dataset to compute gradients.
Pros: Balances efficiency and stability.
Cons: Requires tuning of mini-batch size.
Variants

Momentum: Accelerates convergence using past gradients.
Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG): Computes gradients with a "lookahead" position.
Adagrad: Adapts learning rates based on historical gradients.
RMSprop: Adjusts learning rates based on recent gradients.
Adam: Combines Momentum and RMSprop techniques.
Validation Set & Validation Loss
Validation Set
A subset of data used to evaluate the model during training. It helps in hyperparameter tuning and prevents overfitting by providing unbiased feedback on model performance.

Validation Loss
The loss calculated on the validation set. It measures the model's performance on unseen data and is used to monitor training progress.

Building an MLP Model
Overview
An MLP is a type of neural network with multiple layers used for regression tasks. The following steps outline the process of creating an MLP model using the tips dataset from the Seaborn library.

Steps
Import Libraries

python
Copy code
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
Load and Prepare Data

python
Copy code
tips = sns.load_dataset('tips')
tips = pd.get_dummies(tips, columns=['sex', 'smoker', 'day', 'time'], drop_first=True)
X = tips.drop('tip', axis=1)
y = tips['tip']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
Define the MLP Model

python
Copy code
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)))
model.add(Dense(units=32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(units=1, activation='linear'))
Compile the Model

python
Copy code
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
Train the Model

python
Copy code
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, validation_split=0.2, batch_size=32, verbose=1)
Evaluate the Model

python
Copy code
test_loss = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
Plot Training History

python
Copy code
plt.plot(history.history['loss'])
plt.plot(history.history['val_loss'])
plt.title('Model Loss')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.legend(['Train', 'Validation'])
plt.show()
